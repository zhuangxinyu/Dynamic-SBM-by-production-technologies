# Dynamic-SBM-by-production-technologies

## 1 Background and Motivation
### 1.1 Background
With the rapid development of Taiwan, the demand for energy, such as electricity, power, etc., has also increased. Nonetheless, one of the by-products of using energy is the trash. When the amount of trash is disposed of, there will be more pollution in the atmosphere and soil, causing environmental damage. Since the world aims at zero pollution, Taiwan, as one of the most sustainable countries, has noticed the severity of pollutants and has started to consider this environmental issue.

In Taiwan, the government will not only deal with environmental problems, but also deal with economic problems. The authorities have the responsibility to help each city in Taiwan address these problems. Therefore, the government has to know the overall conditions of each city, including GDP, the amount of labor and trash, and so on. By doing this, the authorities could help improve the cities. The government could know the performance of the cities by using dynamic SBM: by-production technologies, the overall efficiency and dynamic change in the efficiency of the period of cities in Taiwan from 2014 to 2019.

### 1.2 Motivation
Because dynamic SBM: by-production technologies could improve the accuracy of efficiency measurement and solved the problem of not containing slack variables when measuring the inefficiency rate of traditional radial models [[1]](#1). Therefore, we hope this research can give a good estimation of overall and period efficiency of cities, and can also give an insight to find the trend of period efficiency of each city over the entire observed period.

### 1.4 Problem Definition
We would like to calculate the overall and period efficiency of each city from 2014 to 2019. Traditinal methods only calculate the overall efficiency with free disposable input. To measure the efficiency accurately, we use dynamic SBM with by-product technologies to justify the result.
